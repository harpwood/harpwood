# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Haxe and GameMaker: Studio 2 enthusiast. I am also a hobbyist animator. I migrated from Adobe AIR and flash and never looked back (unless I have to maintain the old as3 projects that have not been migrated yet). 

You can see more of my side projects:
* Github : [public repositories](https://github.com/harpwood?tab=repositories) and [gists](https://gist.github.com/harpwood)
* twiter : [@harpwood_studio]([https://x.com/harpwood_studio])
* itch.io : [Harpwood Studio](https://harpwood.itch.io/)
